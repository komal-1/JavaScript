JS is a programming language. We use it to give instructions to the computer.
Input(code) --> Computer --> Output
In window we can go to chrome browser and type inspect and then go to console and type CTRL+K --> It will clear console.

we can create an alert in browser by typing in cosole:-

>alert("My name is Komal"); --> after hitting ENTER it will show a pop-up written My name is Komal.



OUR FIRST JS CODE:

--------------------------------------------------

console.log is used to log(print) a message to the console.
console.log("Komal Kumari");

To connect JAVASCRIPT to browser we have to make a HTML File. By convention we give index name to HTML file.
